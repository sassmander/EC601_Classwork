### Project 2: Minimum Value Product Report from Sentiment Analysis using NLP APIs
#### Project Goals
The goal of this project is to provide a Minimum Value Product for a product using sentiment analysis using both Twitter and Google NLP APIs. 
The overall process is to use a Twitter API to grab and make text database that sentiment analysis NLP API can then analyze for the sentiment of each tweet. 
For this project, the focus became to use NLP API rather than any Twitter APIs after running into access errors while trying to use Botometer and other Twitter-based APIs. 
The database for sentiment analysis was grabbed from one of previous Kaggle competition called "Tweet Sentiment Analysis" and analyzed using a sentiment analysis API.
